# About PHP Programming
--> PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development.<br><br>
--> It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995.<br><br>
--> PHP was originally an abbreviation of Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.<br><br>
--> PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable.<br><br>
--> On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code can be seen.

# Modes of Execution
--> Since PHP is a server side scripting language, execution of PHP requires server.<br><br>
--> XAMPP is used for accessing collected package for PHP.<br>
<h1>XAMPP</h1>
--> X is for Platform as it is platform independent and can run on any platform like Windows, MACOS, Linux or UNIX.<br><br>
--> A stands for Apache Server.This is the server on which PHP compilation is done and output is seen.<br><br>
--> M is for MySQL. MySQL is Structured Query Language Database. It is used to connect PHP to database and take input directly to the database.<br><br>
--> P is for PHP.<br><br>
--> P is for Perl. It is another programming language included in this collected package.<br>

<h1>Getting Started with PHP</h1>
--> First we need to download XAMPP from its official website <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/"><img src="https://www.apachefriends.org/images/xampp-logo-ac950edf.svg" height =40 width=40></a><br><br>
--> Download according to the platform that is going to be used.<br><br>
--> After downloading, load the executble file and follow along the process.<br><br>
--> After this, go to <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/"><img src="https://www.apachefriends.org/images/xampp-logo-ac950edf.svg" height =40 width=40></a> and type localhost.<br><br>
--> If environment is setup, it will show success.<br><br>
--> Go to XAMPP control panel and start apache server.<br><br>
--> After this create a PHP file in any editor like VS code and just give the path after localhost/path_link and you will get the output.<br><br>
